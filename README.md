ROADMAP
=========

There is not much on the roadmap for the mod except to maintain the code for future versions.

The following is the possible roadmap:

1. Create a spigot plugin variant.
2. Explore possibly making a quilt mod variant.
3. Create a permission that a server owner can set to block this mod from functioning on the client.
